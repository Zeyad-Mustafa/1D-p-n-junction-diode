# 1D p-n Junction Simulation

This project simulates a one-dimensional p-n junction diode using Python. It calculates and plots the electrostatic potential, carrier (electron and hole) concentrations, and the current-voltage (I-V) characteristic using the Shockley diode equation.

## Features

- Numerical solution of Poisson's equation for the potential profile
- Calculation of electron and hole concentrations
- Visualization of results
- I-V characteristic plot

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
